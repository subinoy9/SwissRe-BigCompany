# Org Structure Analyzer Service

A lightweight Java-based microservice that analyzes the organizational structure of a company (provided via CSV). It helps identify managers whose compensation may not align with that of their teams — and also detects overly deep reporting hierarchies.

## What it does

- Underpaid Managers — Managers earning less than 20% above the average salary of their direct/subordinate employees

- Overpaid Managers — Managers earning more than 50% above the average salary of their direct/subordinates

- Deep Reporting Lines — Employees whose chain of command exceeds 4 levels

- The service is exposed via RESTful APIs for easy integration or automation.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21

- Apache Maven 3.9.11

- Spring Boot 3.1.4

## Build
```
mvn clean install
```

## Run Service locally

Run Service
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Once started, the service will:

- Launch an embedded Tomcat server

- Initialize all required Spring beans (e.g. controller, CSV-reader component)

- Provide REST endpoints as described below

- Accept CSV input either from a default file or a client-provided path

## API Endpoints
- **POST** `http://localhost:8080/api/import`  
  If no request body is provided, the service automatically loads the default `employees.csv[employees.csv](src/main/resources/employees.csv)`.
